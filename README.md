# Customer Churn Prediction
## Background:
A Marketing Analytics team at company XYZ wants to ensure successful and profit-making rollout for their streaming platform in a new geographical region. THe specs shared with us on the available subscription plan for customers are 30/90 days of free trial, following which they will need to pay based on their plan of selection. The team has the task of coming out with effective metrics to ensure the customers signing up, stay with the company beyond the free trial, thereby generating revenue. 

In such a scenario, understanding and tracking `Customer Churn Rate` as a key metric could help us be proactive in our engagement with our customers and potentially save a churn *before* it could even happen.
