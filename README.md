# Customer Churn Prediction
## Background:
- A Marketing Analytics team at company XYZ wants to ensure successful and profit-making rollout for their streaming platform in a new geographical region
- The specs shared with us on the available subscription plan for customers are 30/90 days of free trial, following which they will need to pay based on their plan of selection
- The team has the task of coming out with effective metrics to ensure the customers signing up, stay with the company beyond the free trial, thereby generating revenue 
- In such a scenario, understanding and tracking `Customer Churn Rate` as a key metric could help us be proactive in our engagement with our customers and potentially save a churn *before* it could even happen
- In the code notebook provided below, steps towards detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning Modeling to predict churn has been shown in Python
- While the presentation deck covers storyline, presentation of insights to action and how the predictions of churn from the machine learning model can translate to profit in marketing revenue!
